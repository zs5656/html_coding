I"o<p>For zombies I’ve concluded that we have three fatal mistakes . Firstly we need to establish one camping ground and stick to it, don’t stray anywhere away until last zombie left. Secondly, we need to each guard one direction of mansion when camping courtyard, 2 person one guard each direction. The people who’s guarding shouldn’t be greedy and turn to the other direction to take some shots, because that increases the likelihood of getting backstabbed and dying. Just guard one direction and stick to it. Tell the other in vc to retreat if zombies getting too close. Lastly, when ur the last person alive, focus on surviving first instead of diving into danger to revive, secure the area first then revive. If need be and ur cornered block your sword while reviving.
That’s for bad blood</p>
