I"<p>you know when you queue 4s with sweaty friends but they actually have a braincell and manage to teamwipe getting 8 finals while you get a nice meaty 0 0 0 game so today i will teach you how to snag all the finals kills and increase your fkdr by 0.0001</p>

<p>2s: queue with corndog then i can steal all the finals that cndg induces an attractive force</p>

<p>3s and 4s: stay in the gen and wait for your teammates to bridge. you can even def if you are a nice person. you must stay in the gen and wait for 7 gold. you then get a iron sword. Iron sword does so much damage at the start of the game when everyone still doesnt have armor and prot. play it safe and dont go into risky fights. you should also try to not take too much damage and die before your team gets the bed, because you will lose your iron sword. when your teammates get the bed, they will most likely get some enemys low and you can go in and final all the people with your iron sword. even if you are by yourself against 2+ people you will still get 1 or 2 finals.</p>
