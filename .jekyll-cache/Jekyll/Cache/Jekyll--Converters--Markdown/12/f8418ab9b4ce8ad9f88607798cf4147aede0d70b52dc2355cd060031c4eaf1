I"È<p>you know when you queue 4s with sweaty friends but they actually have a braincell and manage to teamwipe getting 8 finals while you get a nice meaty 0 0 0 game so today i will teach you how to snag all the finals kills and increase your fkdr by 0.0001</p>

<p>2s: queue with corndog then i can steal all the finals. this is because cndg with his exquisite australian powers utilises Lenzâ€™s law. by lenzâ€™s law cndg upon becoming within a 50 meter radius of the final induces a north pole in the final, thereby the final is attracted towards him and into his final counter.</p>

<p>3s and 4s: leave the defense to someone then make someone else bridge (unless the bridger falls off again uGhGHGhGHghGh). you must stay in the gen and collect 12 gold to purchase iron armour making you indestructible and stronk. this gives you the edge over the soon to be finals waiting to be added to that juicy fkdr. follow the person who is rushing like musers and allow them to obtain the bed. ideally they will charge into the finals, being unable to final kill but subtracting a significant portion of their health. then you can activate your autoclicker i mean your sigma 10+ cps clicking skills and final all the people with your sword. with this method you can get at least 1 or 2 finals or maybe even a teamwipe!</p>

<p>also use snowglobe final kill effect for the full final stealing experience, snowglobe best and it pisses off musers mwahahaha.
i love psychological torture</p>
